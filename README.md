# Type Game

This is a type game built as a project for my portfolio to practice pure JavaScript and CSS animations. The game features a simple yet addictive typing challenge where players have to type the displayed words as fast as possible.

## Features
Pure JavaScript: The game is built entirely with JavaScript, enhancing my skills in the language.
CSS Animations: Cool animations have been implemented using only CSS, adding visual appeal to the game.
Navbar Animation: The navbar features JavaScript animations, providing a smooth user experience.
Online Multiplayer Functionality: Planned future implementation to enable players to compete against each other online.
